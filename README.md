## Section 4 : Ellis Quote

- My buddy **Keith** tried camping out on top of a building once. He was **_shooting crows_**, but the police were too busy *teargassin'* him to ask what he was doin' up there. He screamed for an entire year every single time he opened his eyes! Oh, man! At first, it was funny; then it just got sad, but then it got funny again! Oh, man!

- Man what the hell am I doing.
